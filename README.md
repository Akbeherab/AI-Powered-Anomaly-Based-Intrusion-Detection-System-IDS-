## 📖 Project Summary

This AI-Powered IDS is a **cost-effective, real-time network defense tool** intended for homes, schools, and small organizations. It monitors system usage, processes incoming network data, detects threats using trained ML models, auto-blocks malicious IPs via `iptables`, and displays everything on a clean Flask dashboard.

The system is **plugged in between the router and switch** for seamless traffic analysis, designed to work even in offline environments (ideal for remote and rural deployments).

## 💥 Future Impact

This system lays the groundwork for **decentralized, low-cost cybersecurity** in India. Here’s how it scales:

- 🌍 **Rural & Remote Protection**  
  No internet required – works offline. Ideal for defense installations, rural labs, or unmanned stations.

- 🏫 **Cybersecurity for Education**  
  Can serve as a training tool for students. Helps implement **"Cybersecurity Literacy"** at grassroots.
